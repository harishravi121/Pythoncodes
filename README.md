# Pythoncodes
A list of all my python codes

It has all the codes unsorted into folders from motion to memory games to so on.

I recommend you see different codes right here, look at algorithm for inspiration and do your code (you may be lucky to see complex ones sometimes).

A rubiks cube code costs 100 re to buy and chess against pc 100 re so this are partial codes and thus spread across all viewers if made amazing and explained on social media is worth a lot..
