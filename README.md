# Pythoncodes
A list of all my python codes which are useful!

It has all the codes unsorted into folders from motion to memory games to so on.

I recommend you see different codes right here, look at algorithm for inspiration and do your code (you may be lucky to see complex ones sometimes).

A rubiks cube code costs 100 re to buy and chess against pc 100 re so this are partial codes and thus spread across all viewers if made amazing and explained on social media is worth a lot..

Codes written from 2018-2024-for a long time. These codes are useful for Engineers or Class x-x2 students learning python. Just appreciation of diversity of simple computer problems in world. Can also be taught as summer school for amazing students with deep interest in making advance memories from class 7-10 itself.

I can teach remotely too with close to free for sometime till whereever we can reach.. Just to have fun..

Just mentioning that I can teach a bit of physics and math to students too remotely or give some councelling.. 

The first set of python codes was in 2009-10 where I interfaced FPGAs, expensive optic devices for a quantum optics study towards cryptography.. These are other codes. Later I coded in labview matlab etc during phd which cost 24 lakhs per student. Obviously those skills are prized.
