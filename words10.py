#similaly start with all allowed initiationg letters and other increasing word length with as many for loops 8 ^8 ways or 8factorial ways

#make points hash table
#make board matrix with boosters, # have initiation letter positions #words you can put and blocks for all words and find allowed and extremize the points for that word
#it helps in better vocabulary and helps speed reading as you have visualized the word permutations
#Find conditions for allowed initiation letters and add ons with other letters and keep based on other words
                
#cross words have a thesaurus and dictionary make a network to match the given sentance and that sentance and then see if the words fit with known initiaton or other seed letters
