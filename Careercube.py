import random
Career cube problem
while 1:
    delay 1 day:
    books and courses = 50 ru
    timing=200
    prizen=random.randint(1/timing)

    cost of living per day=100

    cost per year 2 k

    timing=timeing--
    

    


We can make profit when rating is greater than 200

Lets make a nice simulation.
